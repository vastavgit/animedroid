# AnimeDroid
Repository for holding APK and source code of an Android app which displays information about 4 top anime series along with an option to watch instantly

## To use the app in your phone
1. Download the **app-debug.apk** file in your phone
2. Download it as you would do with a normal APK
3. Now, you can use AnimeDroid

### Handling the source code
The **7z** file you see, is the zip file of the source code. Extract it using the 7Zip File Manager. Open Android Studio, then the project in Android Studio. Boom, you have the official source code of our app now

#### Important Note
The app currently has information of only 4 series but that's not what we want to do. So, source code will be updated. There will be a new zip file, with the name **animedroid-updated.7z**, kindly use that new source code. This is not happening at the moment you read this but it will happen soon

##### Thanks for using our app and its source code! We appreciate it :)
